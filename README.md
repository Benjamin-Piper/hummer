# Welcome to Hummer

This is a fun project I made to test out [blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), a frontend framework for C#.

Here are my thoughts:

- I love the syntax of the `.razor` files, more so than React's syntax.
- Hot reloading really wasn't working for me. Maybe because I was using the `<canvas>`.
- Using C# had me thinking object-orientedly again. 
  - Largely a good thing as it got me to think about abstractions and responsibilities again.
  - There were points where I wish it would be flexible with me though.

## About Hummer

On my walks home from university I would often cross over a motorway via footbridge. I realised that with a helicopter view the motorway looks like a music stave. I then imagined whenever a vehicle passed under the footbridge, it would play the note corresponding to which lane it is in.

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome! I don't plan on coming back to this anytime soon, but I will leave issues if anyone wants to add more features.
